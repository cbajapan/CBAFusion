# SwiftFCSDKSample

 In order to see an example of how to use this SDK we have provided a tutorial for you. Once you have fetched the fcsdk-ios package in your project press ``Command + control + shift + d``  and you will build the documentation. Then in the side bar find ``fcsdk-ios -> Build an awesome app using FCSDK-iOS`` and enjoy!
